INTRODUCTION  \\nThe increasing prevalence and usage of digital products have created challenges in searching and retrieving \\ninformation from PDF documents. However, a revolutionary tool called LangChain, built on Natural Language \\nProcessing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM), addresses these challenges. LangChain simplifies the \\nquerying process and information extraction from PDFs using advanced NLP algorithms. To cr eate a user -\\nfriendly interface, LangChain utilizes Streamlit, a web application framework that eliminates the need for \\nexpertise in other web development frameworks like HTML and CSS. Streamlit enables the seamless \\ndeployment of models with minimal coding effort. With LangChain and Streamlit, users can easily interact with \\nPDFs, making document search and retrieval significantly more convenient.  The PDF Query App Project uses \\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and LangChain, a cutting -edge language processing tool, to transform how users \\ninteract with PDF documents. By allowing users to have interactive conversations with PDF documents, this \\nproject solves the fundamental drawbacks of conventional PDF readers. This description highlights the problem \\nstatement and the so lution while also giving a general overview of the project.  \\nII.
